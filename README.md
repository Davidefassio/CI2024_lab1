# Lab 1: Set Cover

Solve a set cover minimization problem using a Random Mutation Hill Climber

## Results

The results for all istances can be seen in the plot at the bottom.


## Limitations

Due to computational and time constraint the algorithm could not run until convergence.

Improve the results by increasing MAX_STEPS to 10K/100K/1M.
